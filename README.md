# Customer Churn Analysis

This repository contains code and resources for analyzing customer churn in a fictional bank dataset. The goal of this project is to create a demographic-centric model that identifies customers at the highest risk of leaving the bank. 

## Problem Description

The bank has been experiencing unusually high churn rates, where customers are leaving the company at a significant rate. To address this issue, a sample of 10,000 customers was taken from the bank's millions of customers in Europe (France, Spain, and Germany). The dataset includes various customer attributes such as credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, balance, number of products, and more. Additionally, the dataset indicates whether each customer has exited the bank within a six-month period.

## Project Scope

The scope of this project is to analyze the provided dataset and develop a predictive model to identify customers who are at a higher risk of leaving the bank. By understanding the factors that influence churn, the model will provide valuable insights for the bank to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions to retain customers.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `Churn_modelling/`: This directory contains the dataset files used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: This directory includes Jupyter notebooks containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- `models/`: This directory stores the trained models generated during the project.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.
- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the dependencies required to run the code successfully.

## Getting Started

To run the code and reproduce the analysis, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-analysis.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd customer-churn-analysis`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory and execute the cells sequentially to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, develop the predictive model, and evaluate its performance.
5. The trained model can be saved in the `models/` directory for future use.
